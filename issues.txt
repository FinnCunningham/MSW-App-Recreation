Issue : solution

-on a spot location to swap between overview and forecast you need to touch at the top of the scree : drag from screens 
-app has two seperate arrows which can be confusing : change to compass like on website with the two arrows on the compass
-arrows in general are confusing : add where north is (it has option to show angle)
-color scheme is boring, just blue white and a bit of green : Use a better color scheme
-text is small in areas : add setting to change (certain) text size
-graphs don't look great : use better graphs
-plain white : use themes
-shows alot of information stright away: hide some clutter with progressive disclosure to show more information once clicked on the element.

-Everything is one size: use visual weight to convey importance
-not color blind friendly: add option in settings maybe with theme
-doesn't show where you are: communicate current location better e.g : back arrow with spots once in a spots screens
- : animations show navigation better
-No loading animations : add animations when changing screens or loading information that is taking awhile
-same as above : skelleton screen / show blank version of the screen while loading in the back
- : Consider thumb zone
